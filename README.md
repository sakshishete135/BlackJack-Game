# BlackJack-Game

The BlackJack Game is a popular Casino Game. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. So the concept is that, you have to keep your score more than the opponent's score but if any player's score goes beyond 21 then that player will lose the game.

How to Play:
Initially player1's cards will shown which will be auto generated, and his current score[Summation of your cards value] too will be shown. Along with this Computer's only first card will shown which help us decide whether to continue the game or not.

Then if player1 chose to continue the game then a new card will be added to his card array i.e current score. If the score exceeds 17 then be careful if you want to continue the game or not, because if you play ahead then there is chance to lose.

Also if the opponent has a blackJack card then also you may lose the game.
